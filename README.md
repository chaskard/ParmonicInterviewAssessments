Use C#, .NET 6 for all questions. Use xUnit for tests when needed.
1	Unit Testing
Write a C# console application that accepts an integer i, and prints an output based on the following:
i is divisible by 3	Print Fizz
i is divisible by 5	Print Buzz
i is divisible by both 3 and 5	Print FizzBuzz
i is not divisible by 3 or 5	Print the value of i
Write unit tests. i could take any legal integer value.
2	ASP NET rate-limiting middleware
Write a custom ASP.NET Core middleware to perform IP-address based rate-limiting. The middleware should not allow more than 10 requests per second per IP address.
Hardcoding values is ok.
3	Data Modelling
Write a set of DDD entity & value-object classes in C# to represent a simple single-entry ledger. Example. Include validation code.
Create a README file explaining it. You may also describe shortcomings.
4	Design
You are in-charge of planning the first iteration of a new backend (no UI) microservice to maintain a single-entry ledger. Write a detailed README file to describe:
•	The microservice’s proposed design. Include a block diagram.
•	How other services should communicate with this one.
•	How it could be deployed to a cloud of your choice.
•	Possible roadblocks, questions, unclear requirements.
